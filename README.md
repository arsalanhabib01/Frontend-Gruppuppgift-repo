# Frontend-Gruppuppgift-repo
Introduction
The company Filmvisarna AB is a small cinema chain that wants to start competing locally with SF. They have a couple of cinema salons in Småstad and have secured rights to show a number of different film titles.

Now they need help building a prototype for a website, where visitors should be able to:

Get information about movies shown, incl. dates and times.
Watch trailers for the movies
Book your cinema tickets online - and find out the total price, placements (row and seat number) and booking number.
(Log in and) see their bookings (both history and upcoming).
Technical requirements
Trello for project planning.
Given for version control, with clear (descriptive) commit messages.
Feature branches in Git (no personal).
Backend: You will get skeleton code in Node.js / JavaScript that you can complete
On the backend, if you choose to use a database, you should use SQLite (instructions will be given on how this works, much like MySQL). You can also choose to save only data in JSON files.
Good system architecture with clear folder structure. (Not a folder that contains the entire program)
No file should be over 300 lines. (Over 200 and it's time to break out parts in another file)
Everyone in the group should work with both HTML / CSS and JavaScript.
You must work agile according to SCRUM, e.g. with sprint planning, daily stands up m.m.
Write your code object-oriented (with clear class names and method names, etc.) or divided into clearly named functions.
Do not use complex frontend frameworks such as Angular, Vue or React.
Feel free to use jQuery as a help library (not a requirement, but a tip).
How do we start?
Designate a SCRUM master for sprint 1.
Start by sketching (lo-fi / wireframes) what the site should look like.
Implement sprint planning (breakdown of user stories into task + play poker and upload user stories and tasks in Trello)
SCRUM-master sets up a git repo and invites all members as "collaborators"
Create necessary JSON data (for shows, movies and salons) and save in JSON files…
Start working on tasks and meet daily for "daily standup" via Teams or another channel.
